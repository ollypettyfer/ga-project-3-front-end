## Requirements:

* Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React

## Technologies:
* Vanilla Javascript
* CSS
* HTML5
* MongoDb
* Express
* React
* Node
* Git
* GitHub

## MVP:

## Build
We all had an equal share of this build, I completed the CRUD functionality on the back-end. 
On the front-end, I took control of the navigation of the site and building up the countries portfolio and linked them to images and users.


## Challenges
* When users dashboard loads the drop pins on the map do not display until the page is interacted with, such as a scroll down the page.

## Wins
* One of our biggest wins was being able to use a map to plot countries around the world on the user’s dashboard.
* When creating a new country and cities visited in that country, the card displays the user’s details of who has created it. This allowed for more search functionality when searching for which countries an individual user has been to.

## Future Developments
* We would like to expand the user’s dashboard further, allowing users to interact with each other through some sort of messaging or chat service.
* Fix the issue with the map displaying correctly on page load.
